CrashCourse
===========

Crash course for Olin College ReadML cocurricular.

#### After completing this tutorial, you should be familiar with:
- linux
- the command line
- version control
- writing simple programs
- finding and utilizing external resources (the internet is your very knowledgeable friend)
- best practices and good software habits
- testing code and debugging issues

#### Notes about these things

- Definitely cannot do in only one session
- We feel meh about making them all OIE seminars... otherwise it'll seem very much catered towards first-years (we'll get a different crowd)
- Maybe inspirational talk about computing + linux install party can be an OIE seminar
- Python should have its own day
- github should sneak in there somehow, but it's important to emphasize version control
- Should be first-year friendly, but anyone interested should participate (e.g., version control is something that all grades should know and appreciate)
- Should be a good introduction to all of these things but ideally we'll spark an interest to get to know these tools even better and learn lots on their own too :)
- We should be explicit about asking for feedback on this module and iterate for the sake of future semesters/ReadML members :D

#### Prototype of our schedule:
- The two nights before: linux install party 1 and 2. include a short inspirational talk about computing/linux
- First meeting: Talk and ideate about ReadML (1hr), do the python crash course (1hr)
- Second meeting: Module 1 happens (people download the ipython notebook and start to play with it at their own pace). Github/version control talk happens. Community shenanigans and collaborative learning, woot!
- ReadML hangouts (friendlier than NINJA hours, cool times to code and hang out with people outside of the ReadML time)
- Third meeting and so on... modules!

#### Add on to this list as we think about these things...
List of resources we should have had (what we didn't know we didn't know)
- Utilize your resources
- Learning how to find edge cases
