      "\n",
      "When your computer begins to boot up, hold down the F12 key to bring up the One-Time Boot Menu.  From here, you can select your USB stick to boot from.  An Ubuntu install screen should appear. Ubuntu is a linux distribution (a.k.a flavor).  \n",
      "\n",
      "For the most part, you can use the default settings when installing.  If you have more questions, feel free to ask us about details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure to check the \"Install updates\" button to make sure your Ubuntu partition is ready to go after installing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This will set aside a portion of your hard drive (a partition) to be used for the Ubuntu operating system.  Your Windows operating system installed by default will no longer be able to access this space, so make sure to leave your windows drive some room to expand.  You can drag the sliders around to choose how much space to allocate for Ubuntu -- 50 GB is probably plenty for now.  You can extend the size of your Ubuntu drive later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The install process shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When you reboot your computer, you'll be presented with a dialog to select which operating system you'd like to use.  If you don't watch as your computer boots up, it will likely choose an operating system for you.  After this installation, Ubuntu will be your default operating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Getting around Linux \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Opening up a terminal\n",

      "\n",
      "To install Sublime, the text editor of choice at Olin, you'll need to add a new repository (source for software) to apt-get.  Then you'll need to run `sudo apt-get update`, which refreshes the list of repositories used by apt-get.  Finally, you can install Sublime with apt-get like you're used to.    \n",
